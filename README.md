TITLE : MUSCLEMENTOR!Software Proposal

TEAM MEMBERS:
Bunroung H., Sara A., Amna S., Fady E.

DESCRIPTION:
 Our software will allow the user to track their weight, calculate their BMI, and start a
 fitness journey through our software. Our application will target the user's progress based on
 their account and even give a workout plan for each day in the schedule based on their goals. For
 example, if the user wants to gain muscle mass, their workout plan will consist of low-intensity,
 and hypertrophy workouts, however, if the user is planning on losing weight, they will be given
 a high-intensity workout routine that also tracks their weight and goal. An idea to help motivate
 people to use the software regularly is to give regular users coupon codes for healthy or
 high-protein meals.
